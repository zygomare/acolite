;; Coefficients for the Hue Angle algorithm (Van der Woerd et al., 2018 https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10020180)
;;
;; tabulated by QV 2018-04-18
;;
;; updated polynomials for S2A and S2B provided by Hans in April 2018
;; QV 2018-09-12 updated with nominal wavelengths and adding the 705 after feedback from HVDW
;; QV 2022-03-07 updated L9_OLI is placeholder with same coeffs as L8_OLI
;; QV 2022-03-15 updated L9_OLI coefficients received from Hans, same for L8 except polynomial is updated using L9 RSR https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/sites/landsat/files/2021-10/L9_OLI2_Ball_FPM_RSR.v1.0.xlsx
;; QV 2025-02-11 added L7_ETM and MERIS coefficients (and OLCI as copy of MERIS, S2C as copy of S2B)
